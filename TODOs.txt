Taxon migration TODOs:

- map the three letter language codes to two letter codes - done
- add the distribution data to the taxon - done
- add the distribution fields in Specify -done
- check values of distribution.taxonreferencesource vs taxonreference - all a mess. just pulling in as it is
- also sort out out publicationDetails vs taxonreferencesource vs webreference -  as above
- move barcodeStatus to nativeStatus - done for termites
- fix all the sql server models - done
- work out how to deal with the references - See below. 
But first need to parse out the author names, see https://www.crossref.org/labs/resolving-citations-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-parser/
Do this afterwards, just store the referenceIDs to use!

NB TODO: remove duplicates from taxonReferences
